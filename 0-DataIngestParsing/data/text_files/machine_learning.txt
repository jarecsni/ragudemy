Machine learning algorithms learn patterns from data without explicit programming.
Supervised learning uses labeled data to predict outcomes on new examples.
Unsupervised learning finds hidden structures in data without target labels.
Neural networks mimic brain neurons with interconnected layers of nodes.
Deep learning uses multiple hidden layers to model complex relationships.
Overfitting occurs when models memorize training data but fail on new data.
Cross-validation splits data to test model performance on unseen examples.
Feature engineering transforms raw data into meaningful model inputs.
Gradient descent optimizes model parameters by minimizing prediction errors.
